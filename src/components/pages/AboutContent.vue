                Additionally, I pursued further professional development by studying web development in Canada. This
                experience
                not only expanded my technical knowledge but also gave me exposure to different cultural perspectives. I am
                passionate about using my expertise in IT consulting and web development to create innovative solutions and
                drive positive change in the digital landscape.
